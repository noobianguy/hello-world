# hello-world
This is my first attempt at using github.  I am new I am a noobian
It is very strange to me this new method of self teaching.  Just following exapmles and text to learn.
I like this as there is little pressure to please an instructor, take tests, or make some "grade".
the only approval I am seeking is my own.  If I feel like I am doing good then I am.
so really you can if you think you can!
